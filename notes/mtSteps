    rake db:migrate
      [WARNING] - The list of tenants to migrate appears to be empty.
      because it really is


    edit routes file
      scope "/mt/:subdomain" do
        resources :facilities
        resources :tenants
      end
    edit applcation_controller.rb
      before_filter :set_tenant

      def set_tenant
        @tenant_id = params[:subdomain] || "dev"
      end

      def url_options
        {:subdomain => @tenant_id}.merge(super)
      end    

    make a dev tenant
      rails c
      nt = Tenant.create(name: "dev", description: "tenant for development")
      
    show db stuff
      tables are separated...
      select count(*) from products;
        42
      set search_path to dev;
      select count(*) from products;
        0
      unique id's are each in their own schema space
        select * from products_id_seq;
        select * from public.products_id_seq;

    show urls
      http://localhost:3000/mt/dev/facilities/prod_list
      http://localhost:3000/mt/public/facilities/prod_list

problems
  initial user is in the "public" namespace
  so are the "pinned" models like tenant
    needs to be moved


-- data issues
  how to use sql to move tenant data to new tenant
  add data to dev tenant using the loaders

  alter schema public rename to cust1;
  create schema public;
  -- need to get tables into public, move cust1.tenant data to public.tenant
  rake db:migrate
    [WARNING] - The list of tenants to migrate appears to be empty.
  insert into tenants (select * from cust1.tenants);
  insert into tenants values ('2','cust1','original ST client',now(), now());
  --- looks like the sequence is still at 1.......
  ALTER SEQUENCE tenants_id_seq RESTART WITH 3;
  rake db:migrate
    -doing the right thing now
    Migrating dev tenant
    Migrating cust1 tenant    
  make new tenant
    nt = Tenant.create(name: "c3", description: "the third customer")
    worked !


  upload facilities2.csv
  http://localhost:3000/mt/c3/facilities
  download it
  facilites.csv
  notice the auto ID = 1
    show why in psql
  fixup the product file with the id
  upload the products

  show the final demo
    -- no code differences
    -- no database differences
    -- different data for different groups of users
